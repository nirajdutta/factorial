Create a new Java or Kotlin class named FactorialCalculator.
Write a public static long calculateFactorial(int n) method within the class,
which takes an integer n as its parameter and returns the factorial of n as a long.
Implement the method using recursion. You can assume that n will always be a non-negative integer.
Ensure that your program handles the base case where n is 0, and in that case, return 1 (as 0! is defined as 1).
Test your program with various values of n to verify its correctness.
Your code should be well-documented with comments explaining the recursive logic and any important considerations.
